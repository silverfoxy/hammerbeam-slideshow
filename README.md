# Hammerbeam Slideshow
This is a zmk module to implement a slideshow of 30 of Hammerbeam's 1 bit art on the peripheral (right) nice!view display.

Hammerbeam, _the original artist of the iconic balloon and mountain art found in the default zmk firmware for the nice!view screen_, has more fantastic 1 bit art that you may not have seen.

With Hammerbeam's consent, he allowed me use what I wanted of his public posts of his 1-bit art and format them as necessary to bring more of his work to the nice!view display. I made sure to keep his signature in each picture for attribution so others can find more of his work.

The picture to be displayed by this module on the peripheral screen will be one of these 30 and will change every 10 seconds.

## Usage

To use this module, first add it to your config/west.yml by adding a new entry to remotes and projects:

```yml
manifest:
  remotes:
      # zmk official
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: gpeye                         #new entry
      url-base: https://github.com/GPeye  #new entry
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: hammerbeam-slideshow          #new entry
      remote: gpeye                       #new entry
      revision: main                      #new entry
  self:
    path: config
```

Now simply swap out the default nice_view shield on the board for the custom one in your build.yaml file.

```yml
---
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: urchin_left nice_view_adapter  nice_view
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: urchin_right nice_view_adapter nice_view_custom #custom shield
```

by default the this urchin animation will run for a duration of 300 seconds, 10 seconds per picture, fairly slow to save battery

If you want to change the speed of the animation, you can edit the speed by changing the CONFIG_CUSTOM_ANIMATION_SPEED in your .conf file

For example:

```conf
# urchin.conf
CONFIG_CUSTOM_ANIMATION_SPEED=9000000 # 9000 second total duration
# 30 pictures, so 300 seconds (5m) per picture
```
